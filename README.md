Crear un sistema básico de robots que demuestre los conceptos fundamentales de POO en Python
This project implements a comparative analysis of solar resources and the simulation of a Trina Solar 585W photovoltaic panel, using Python libraries for data analysis such as pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, along with an Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) approach. The meteorological data comes from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) and includes two locations: Montería in Colombia and Berlin in Germany. The main objective is to evaluate the solar potential of both locations, calculate the annual, monthly, and daily energy generated by the panel, and present the results through statistics, plots, and performance metrics.

The Trina 585W panel used in this simulation has the following specifications: nominal power at STC of 585 W, panel area of 2.703 m², nominal efficiency of 21.6%, a temperature coefficient (Pmax) of -0.34%/°C, a nominal operating cell temperature (NOCT) of 43 °C, an open-circuit voltage (Voc) of 46.6 V, and a short-circuit current (Isc) of 15.99 A. A system loss factor of 15% is applied to account for wiring, inverter, and other real-world inefficiencies.

The repository is implemented in Python 3.10+ and requires only three main libraries: pandas, numpy, and matplotlib. Once the cleaned meteorological dataset (datos_combinados.csv) is available, the analysis can be run directly by executing the main script. The code processes irradiance, ambient temperature, and time series data, computes cell temperature using the NOCT model, adjusts power generation with the temperature coefficient, and calculates the effective output power after losses.

Running the program produces descriptive statistics of irradiance, temperature, and energy for each location, along with comparative plots that show monthly energy production, monthly irradiance, monthly average temperature, and total annual production. These results provide a clear comparison between Berlin and Montería, highlighting the impact of geographical and climatic conditions on photovoltaic performance.

The implementation follows an object-oriented approach, where the PanelSolar class encapsulates the technical characteristics of the module and includes methods for processing input data, calculating power, and aggregating energy production at daily, monthly, and annual levels. The methodology is supported by technical references such as Solar Engineering of Thermal Processes by Duffie and Beckman, Solar Cells: Operating Principles by Green, and official documentation from the NREL NSRDB.
